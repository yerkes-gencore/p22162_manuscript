# Formula for DESeq2 design. Has not been rigorously tested with multifactor designs. Consider
# making your design one combined factor as per the vignette: https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#contrasts
# Group should always be included as the primary term. Additional terms can be included from the
# sample metadata by using the column name of the term in that table
design: 'Group + Responders'
# Level of primary design factor to use as baseline for comparisons in heatmap
designBaseline: adeno
# Contrasts to examine, based on levels of the factor(s) used as the design formula.
# Separate levels with "vs" or "over" and some characters (spaces, underscores, dashes etc)
# E.g.: Level1_vs_Level2   or   AB over BC
